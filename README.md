# Django Healthcare Prediction Website

This Django project implements a healthcare prediction website for diabetes detection using machine learning techniques. It utilizes a trained Random Forest Classifier to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on user input.

## Overview

Healthcare prediction websites serve as valuable tools for early diagnosis and prevention of diseases. This project focuses on predicting diabetes risk using patient information such as age, gender, BMI, blood glucose level, etc.

## Features

- **Diabetes Prediction**: Users can input their health parameters and receive a prediction regarding their diabetes risk.
- **Secure Data Handling**: User inputs are encrypted using AES encryption before being processed, ensuring data privacy.
- **Trained Model Integration**: The project integrates a pre-trained Random Forest Classifier for diabetes prediction.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/healthcare-prediction-website.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Django server:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

4. Access the website at `http://localhost:8000/`.

## Usage

1. Navigate to the website and fill in the required health parameters in the form.
2. Submit the form to receive a prediction regarding your diabetes risk.

## Security Measures

- **AES Encryption**: User inputs are encrypted using AES encryption to protect sensitive health information.
- **Key Management**: A fixed key is used for encryption, but in a production environment, secure key management should be implemented.

## Model Training

- The Random Forest Classifier model is trained using patient data to predict diabetes risk.
- The model and data preprocessing steps are implemented in the `train_model.ipynb` notebook.
